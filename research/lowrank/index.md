    The research group of Andreas Grüneis at 
    <a href="https://www.tuwien.ac.at/">Vienna University of Technology</a>
    (until 2018 partly hosted by
    <a href="https://www.fkf.mpg.de/">MPI for Solid State Research in Stuttgart</a>)
    develops, implements and applies wave function based methods for the study of ground- 
    and excited state properties in solid state systems. We aim at the
    accurate description of electronic correlation effects using
    many-electron methods such as coupled cluster theories. Our
    research is highly interdisciplinary and situated at the crossroads
    of theoretical condensed matter physics, computational materials
    physics and theoretical quantum chemistry.
