title: Molecular adsorption on surfaces
---
Molecular adsorption on surfaces is a fundamentally important process
in catalysis, gas storage, water purification, and many other areas. A
key challenge in understanding the underlying mechanisms in molecular
adsorption and desorption processes is having accurate electronic
structure theories that we can solve for realistic extended surface
models.
