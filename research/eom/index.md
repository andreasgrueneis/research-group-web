title: Calculating excited states in solids
---

One very important aspect of practical applications and theoretical
developments in solids is the accurate study of excited electronic states.

In our group we aim to do this in the framework of the *Equation of Motion*
coupled cluster theory. We are interested in accurately treating systems like
colour centers in solids and excited state chemical reaction pathways on
surfaces.
